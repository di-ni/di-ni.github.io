My research draws inspiration from biological systems to overcome the challenges in miniaturize
robotic swarms. I aim to develop cost-effective, small-scale robots for practical applications, such as exploring
cluttered environments, monitoring ecosystems, and gathering high-resolution ocean observations.

# Research Areas

## Underwater Miniaturized Robot Swarm

Underwater robot collectives can benefit from moving
in formation, for predictable spatial sampling, shared navigation, and potential energy savings. Using
BlueSwarm, an underwater swarm platform with 3D maneuverability and 3D perception, I
demonstrated how robots can navigate in various configurations (following behind or alongside, abovebelow,
in a diamond shape) using visual but noisy interactions. This is the first experimental realization
of an entirely vision-based 3D formation control, using a behavior-based leader-follower strategy 9. This
work establishes a foundation for creating fish-like robot swarms capable of moving in energy-efficient
formations, mimicking the behavior of natural fish schools.

### Key Research Components:
- Swarm coordination algorithms for underwater environments
- Miniaturized underwater vehicles 
- Bio-inspired design principles



## Small Robotics Platform

Despite significant progress in small-sized robotic
systems over the past two decades, most platforms
lack sufficient payload capacity for onboard power
due to size constraints. Developing strong actuators
and compact power supplies is thus crucial for realizing
full autonomous operation in small robots. While
individual miniature robots have limited payload and
computing capacity, exploring swarm strategies can
potentially overcome these limitations and unlock
new capabilities.

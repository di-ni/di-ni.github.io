Nature showcases small organisms with remarkable individual locomotion capabilities and collective behaviors â€” from hummingbirds displaying exceptional agility and precise hovering, to schools of fish navigating thousands of miles in coordinated, adaptive group patterns.
These collectives demonstrate an incredible level of **self-organization**, where large numbers of relatively simple agents rely on local interactions to produce complex global behaviors. As a result, the system as a whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. What makes these systems so fascinating to scientists and engineers is that, despite each individual having limited capabilities, the collective achieves a remarkable degree of autonomy.

My research draws inspiration from biological systems and aims to develop artificial collectives of our own. I focus on creating cost-effective, small-scale robots that can form robotic fleets mimicking biological collectives in several highly desirable ways:
(1) exhibiting complex and coherent behavior across large physical scales despite each individual's severely limited perception;
(2) achieving decentralized coordination with high robustness to individual failures;
(3) leveraging collective action and sensing to enhance efficiency and adaptability.

# Research Areas

## Formation Control in Swarm using Implicit Cooridination
The schooling behavior of fish is hypothesized to confer many survival benefits, including foraging success, safety
from predators, and energy savings through hydrodynamic interactions when swimming in formation. Underwater robot
collectives may achieve similar benefits using formation control in future applications, e.g. efficient spatial sampling for
environmental monitoring. Although many theoretical algorithms exist for multi-robot formation control, few have been
tested in the underwater domain due to fundamental challenges in underwater communication. Here, we introduce a
leader-follower strategy that enables the first realizations of complex three-dimensional (3D) underwater formations
using visual information alone. We successfully demonstrate leader-follower pairs executing various 3D following
configurations (inline, staggered, and side-by-side formations) and further showcase a multi-robot diamond formation.
Comparisons between experimental results and simulation predictions highlight formation-specific challenges for
underwater environments, particularly in visual perception, fluid dynamic control, and resource-constrained onboard
computing. These findings lay the foundation for future applications of underwater robot swarms in aquatic environments
with minimal communication.

## Small Robotics Platform

Despite significant progress in small-sized robotic
systems over the past two decades, most platforms
lack sufficient payload capacity for onboard power
due to size constraints. Developing strong actuators
and compact power supplies is thus crucial for realizing
full autonomous operation in small robots.
 <!-- While
individual miniature robots have limited payload and
computing capacity, exploring swarm strategies can
potentially overcome these limitations and unlock
new capabilities. -->

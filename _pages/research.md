Nature showcases small organisms with remarkable
individual locomotion and collective behaviors
â€“ from hummingbirds demonstrating great
agility and precise hovering, to schools of fish
navigating thousands of miles in adaptive group
patterns. Imagine replicating such feats with
swarms of small robots.

My research draws inspiration from biological systems to overcome the challenges in miniaturize robotic swarms. I aim to develop cost-effective, small-scale robots for practical applications, such as exploring cluttered environments, monitoring ecosystems, and gathering high-resolution ocean observations.

# Research Areas

## Formation Control in Swarm using Implicit Cooridination
The schooling behavior of fish is hypothesized to confer many survival benefits, including foraging success, safety
from predators, and energy savings through hydrodynamic interactions when swimming in formation. Underwater robot
collectives may achieve similar benefits using formation control in future applications, e.g. efficient spatial sampling for
environmental monitoring. Although many theoretical algorithms exist for multi-robot formation control, few have been
tested in the underwater domain due to fundamental challenges in underwater communication. Here, we introduce a
leader-follower strategy that enables the first realizations of complex three-dimensional (3D) underwater formations
using visual information alone. We successfully demonstrate leader-follower pairs executing various 3D following
configurations (inline, staggered, and side-by-side formations) and further showcase a multi-robot diamond formation.
Comparisons between experimental results and simulation predictions highlight formation-specific challenges for
underwater environments, particularly in visual perception, fluid dynamic control, and resource-constrained onboard
computing. These findings lay the foundation for future applications of underwater robot swarms in aquatic environments
with minimal communication.

- Miniaturized underwater vehicles 
- Bio-inspired design principles -->



## Small Robotics Platform

Despite significant progress in small-sized robotic
systems over the past two decades, most platforms
lack sufficient payload capacity for onboard power
due to size constraints. Developing strong actuators
and compact power supplies is thus crucial for realizing
full autonomous operation in small robots.
 <!-- While
individual miniature robots have limited payload and
computing capacity, exploring swarm strategies can
potentially overcome these limitations and unlock
new capabilities. -->
